# Pebs: A Community-Based Exchange System

## Basic Definition
- "Pebs" is short for "digital pebbles"
- A system for tracking exchanges of goods and services
- Not equivalent to money or capital in the traditional sense
- Named after actual pebbles used for trade by early Pangans

## Core Principles

### Community Benefit
- Based on the concept that all exchange benefits the community as a whole
- Facilitates exchange through the community rather than tracking individual trades
- Acknowledges mutual benefit within society

### Labor Recognition
- Pebs acknowledge someone's labor and thank them for their contribution
- Receiving pebs signifies that one's work is valued
- Being given pebs means being seen as a person (or equal to a person)

## How Pebs Work

### Exchange Process
1. Everyone starts with zero pebs
2. When receiving goods or services, you give pebs to the provider
3. This creates a negative balance for you
4. You provide your own goods or services to others to receive pebs
5. This creates a positive balance
6. The cycle continues throughout the community

### Example Flow
- Farmer provides food → receives pebs
- Musician plays music → receives pebs
- Technician repairs infrastructure → receives pebs
- Each person both gives and receives within the network

### Practical Tracking
- Typically tracked via pocket computers
- Can be recorded on paper when necessary
- All balances are public information

## Debt and Balance

### Negative Balances
- Having a negative balance is not penalized
- Temporary negative balances are considered normal ("part of the ebb and flow")
- Large negative balances may indicate someone needs help (illness, personal difficulties)
- Community members check in on those with significant negative balances

### Accountability
- No formal penalties prevent people from taking without giving
- Social accountability - "it's a bad feeling" to maintain a large negative balance
- System relies on mutual support rather than punishment

## Uses for Pebs

### Common Exchanges
- Food and necessities
- Supplies and goods
- Services (repairs, music, etc.)
- Lodging
- Anything one wants or appreciates

### Key Principle
- No one should be "barred from necessities or comforts just because they don't have the right number next to their name"

## Cultural Significance
- Being given pebs signifies inclusion in society
- The system reinforces interdependence and community connection
- Represents a shift from previous economic systems ("we don't do that anymore")
