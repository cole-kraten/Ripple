# Ripple: A Community-Based Exchange System

## Basic Definition
- "Pebs" is short for "digital pebbles"
- Pebs are used to help us recognize the labour of others, and thank them for it
- Pebs are NOT equivalent to money or capital in the traditional sense, as they do not create barriers to access
- Named after actual pebbles used for trade by early Pangans (within the story of "Monk and Robot")

## How Pebs Work

### Exchange Process
1. Everyone starts with zero pebs
2. When you benefit from someone's labour, you give them pebs to say thanks
3. This creates a negative balance for you
4. You create benefits for others, and you receive pebs as thanks
5. This creates a positive balance
6. The cycle continues throughout the community

## Debt and Balance

### Negative Balances
- Having a negative balance is not penalized
- Temporary negative balances are considered normal ("part of the ebb and flow")
- Large negative balances may indicate someone needs help (illness, personal difficulties)
- Community members check in on those with significant negative balances

### Accountability
- No formal penalties prevent people from taking without giving
- The system relies on mutual support rather than punishment
